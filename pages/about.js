              Let me introduce myself: <br></br>
              <br></br>My name is Antonio Beltr√°n, I am a Spanish self-taught
              web developer currently living in Manchester (UK). I came to this
              country 4 years ago with the intention of progressing in my career
              in Bussiness Management, and soon I started working at
              Booking.com. This was a crucial experience since it allowed me to
              discover my new passion: programming.

              After completing several courses on Web Design and SEO, I was
              getting more and more interested in developing a whole website
              from scratch, so I completed the most exhaustive bootcamp I could
              find: The 2021 Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp by the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/">App Brewery.</a> This
              training really opened my eyes to the wonders of programming, and
              I have not stopped learning since then. You can check my Skills in
              the next page, or download my CV from{" "}
