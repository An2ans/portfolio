It is my first app built using Next.js and was developed as a project within the course Complete Next Developer 2022 by ZTM Academy. The app shows you 9 default coffee stores from Manchester city center, and 30 more via geolocation, therefore anyone in any location can use it. If you click on the store, you can find the name, postcode, address, and you can vote it up! Dynamic routes are used for the coffee store pages, using the id as a param, so you can access directly to your fab coffee store page. Pictures are generated using an API from Unsplash. ",

Firebase is the database to store collections and users, since setting users permissions is very intuitive using this platform. OAuth with google account is added. ",
